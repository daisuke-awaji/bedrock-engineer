# üßô Bedrock Engineer

Bedrock Engineer is an AI assistant for software development tasks powered by [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/). This autonomous AI agent combines the capabilities of large language models with practical file system operations and web search functionality to support your development process.

## üíª Demo

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/788583b6-148b-4e9d-9015-c24ad4be6162

## üçé Getting Started

It is still under development and no packaged binaries have been created. Please build it locally and use it.

### Build

First, install the npm modules:

```
npm install
```

Then, build application package

```
npm run build:mac
```

or

```
npm run build:win
```

or

```
npm run build:linux
```

Use the application stored in the `dist` directory.

## ‚ú® Features

### Agent Chat

The autonomous AI agent capable of development assists your development process. It provides functionality similar to AI assistants like [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline), but with its own UI that doesn't depend on editors like VS Code. This enables richer diagramming and interactive experiences in Bedrock Engineer's agent chat feature. Additionally, with agent customization capabilities, you can utilize agents for use cases beyond development.

The agent's capabilities can be extended by registering commands that connect to databases, execute APIs, or invoke other AI agents. |

### Website Generator

Generate and preview website source code in real-time. Currently supports the following libraries, and you can interactively generate code by providing additional instructions:

- React.js (w/ Typescript)
- Vue.js (w/ Typescript)
- Svelte.js
- Vanilla.js

Here are examples of screens generated by the Website Generator:

| ![website-gen](./assets/website-generator.png) | ![website-gen-data](./assets/website-generator-data-visualization.png) | ![website-gen-healthcare](./assets/website-generator-healthcare.png) |
| :--------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|          House Plant E-commerce Site           |                           Data Visualization                           |                           Healthcare Blog                            |

The following styles are also supported as presets:

- Inline styling
- Tailwind.css
- Material UI (React mode only)

#### Connect to Design System Data Source

By connecting to Amazon Bedrock's Knowledge Base, you can generate websites referencing any design system, project source code, or website styles.

You need to store source code and crawled web pages in the knowledge base in advance. When registering source code in the knowledge base, it is recommended to convert it into a format that LLM can easily understand using methods such as [gpt-repository-loader](https://github.com/mpoon/gpt-repository-loader). Figma design files can be referenced by registering HTML and CSS exported versions to the Knowledge Base.

Click the "Connect" button at the bottom of the screen and enter your knowledge base ID.

### Step Functions Generator

Generate AWS Step Functions ASL definitions and preview them in real-time.
